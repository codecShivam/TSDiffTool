| Use Case | Scenario | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Version Control System Integration** | You are building a version control system (VCS) or integrating a diff tool into an existing VCS system (e.g., Git). | The TypeScript Diff Tool can be used to calculate the difference between different versions of a file. This information is crucial for a VCS to understand what lines were added, modified, or deleted between commits. |
| **Code Review Tool** | In a code review tool, developers review each other's code changes before merging them into the main branch. | The TypeScript Diff Tool can be used to generate a patch file representing the changes made by a developer. The reviewer can then apply this patch to their local copy to see the exact modifications, facilitating a more detailed code review. |
| **Text Document Comparison** | You are building an application for comparing versions of text documents, helping users identify changes between different revisions. | The TypeScript Diff Tool can be employed to compare two versions of a document, highlighting insertions, deletions, and modifications. This can be useful for collaborative writing platforms or document versioning systems. |
| **Automated Patching in Deployment** | During the deployment process, you need to update configuration files or scripts on the server while preserving any manual changes. | The TypeScript Diff Tool can generate a patch file representing the changes. During deployment, this patch can be applied to update the files on the server, ensuring that manual modifications are retained. |
| **Localization File Updates** | When managing localization files for different languages, you want to update translations without losing existing translations. | The TypeScript Diff Tool can be used to generate a patch file when updating a base translation file. This patch can then be applied to the translated files, updating only the necessary parts without affecting custom translations. |
